## Breaking Changes
None - all changes are backward compatible.

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise, the following can be reverted:
1. Linting fixes: Revert individual file changes
2. SyncManager: Remove provider registration and file
3. All changes tracked in git history

## Testing Status
- Unit tests: SyncManager tests passing
- Integration tests: Authentication flow verified
- Widget tests: Basic UI tests functional
- E2E tests: Manual testing completed

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining linting issues (~600 left)
